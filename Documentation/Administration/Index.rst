.. warning::

   This extension generates raw javacript codes from the network configurations in the backend.

   Most often, simple configurations are taken from the vis.js documentation. However, more complex
   configurations can be entered. As said in the TYPO3 Security Guide, "*Even if editors do not insert malicious code intentionally,
   sometimes the lack of knowledge, expertise or security awareness could put your website under risk*".

   Admin users should be careful before granting the rights for backend users to enter networks.
